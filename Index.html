        <p >
            
         First and foremost, I'd want to express my gratitude for taking the time to read my profile. 
         I'd like to provide a brief overview of my experience. Throughout my Information Technology course,
         I will tell you about my IT journey and share tales from all of the interviews I conducted with various
         organizations Please bear with me since this narrative is going to be long, and some of the details will
         be difficult to follow.It's possible that you won't be able to read the entire profile in one sitting hahaha 
         just kidding .
        
        </p>

        <P>
          Saraphina is a 27-year-old graduate with a National Diploma in Information Technology and an Advanced Diploma
          in Information Technology from the Vaal University of Technology. I am extremely thrilled that I have completed
          a brief goal that I set for myself, and now that I am on another path to complete my skills as a graduate, I am
          grateful to have been chosen and to join the Mlab team in this codetribe web development bootcamp. I'm excited 
          to learn new abilities and be able to put them to use in the profession.
         </P>

         <P>
          Despite all of the ups and downs in my job search, I am grateful that I never quit up. I've never gotten a good 
          news email; they've always been rejections. I will also attend to interviews, but they never call me back. I was
          about to give up when I received a text from Mlab. This bootcamp provided me something to concentrate on. This 
          journey has caught my attention. Never give up, something will always come up, is my motto.
          </P>
