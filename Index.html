               my Information Technology course, my IT journey and share a detail about my employment history. 
               Please bear with me this is going to be long, and some of the details will be difficult to follow.
               I hope you like it and please contact us if you would like to make a profile similar to this one.

              Saraphina is a 27-year-old graduate with a National Diploma in Information Technology and an Advanced Diploma
              in Information Technology from the Vaal University of Technology. I am extremely thrilled that I have completed
              a brief goal that I set for myself which was getting my degree, and who knew that 2022 I  will be on 
             a journey with codetribe web development bootcamp to gain experience, I am grateful to have been 
             selected to join Mlab team. I'm excited to learn new skills and be able to put them to use now and in the future.
             </P>

             <P>
              I believe that having that one skill that one can learn in order to flourish in the IT field is essential to having a
              successful journey throughout the profession. I'm not going to stop until I get to where I want to be. For the year
              2022, I have registered for a Postgraduate Diploma in Information Technology. I'd like to continue my study while
              still gaining experience at mlab. This bootcamp is assisting me in launching my career as a developer, which I am
              highly interested in and have invested time and effort into.
              </P>
