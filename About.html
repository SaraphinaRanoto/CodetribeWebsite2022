           During my studies in Advanced Diploma I have majored in Statistic for Information Systems, Emerging Technologies,
           Information Technology Management, Advanced Database, User Experince Design and Research Methodology. And for my National Diploma 
           I have majored in Business Analysis, software Development and Information Systems. I have acquired alot of information 
           that I would love to apply practically in the real world. My very first project was to develop a system using java programming language
           to create a program that allows a user to place orders and make a purchase of any gadgets in store, to print reciept and just to make
           changes on the system. Some of the skills I have acquired during and after the project include:<br>

            This projects helped me on how to be a team player. The second one, we worked on  UX/UI a project that would help students stay on top of thier work and avoid missing deadlines
            or any other school related events. We deployed questionnaires to ask student how covid-19 was affecting their 
            studies and what they would like to see in a companion App to traverse it. And thirdly, We developed a system in Oracle
            that allowed us to input data,delete and update data using SQL. We did data querying, manipulation and I also gained
            a sharp capacity to organize data for optimal usage in order to produce reports of the output data.

             Monthhs after graduating for my Diploma I got an internship at Department of Education as a Feild
             Support Engineer. It was a 9 months contract, basically I was mostly dealing with hardware and 
             software issues. I have gained experience and learned alot like having good commucation skills, being punctual
             and energetic and also making sure that the service required must be delivered on time and  if you have difficulty completing a task 
             you had to do some research or escalate the matter to a mentor. But I later realsised that Support Desktop technician was not for me simply
             because I felt like there are no challenges. I needed something that would keep me up and learning more and more each day.
             I worked because I had no other choice, I still apply for support job posts.

            I got the internship after a very long time, I applied everyday and I only got few responses but I never gave up. I
            couldnt, despite all of the ups and downs in my job search, I am grateful that I never gave up. It is only few emails with good 
            news; like invitation to interviews and stuff. At some point I thought it was my CV but now I see that nothing is wrong with it.
            I was over the moon when I received a text from Mlab. I was hungry for this kind of an opportunity, to me this my foundation, the start 
            to becoming a developer. Never give up, something will always come up, is my motto.

            It is critical to put oneself out there and experience the journey, as well as to learn skills and be able to use them.
            It's no longer about being a part of a specific organization; it's about the abilities we have, what we have to contribute,
            and that's what will propel our careers forward. As technology advances, it is critical to investigate and learn more about
            new technical abilities. We are the ones who must change the worlds and struggle to prevent ourselves from being ruled by
            technology. We are the future, and we must continue to learn. Thank you for taking the time to look over my profile.

             the world.
